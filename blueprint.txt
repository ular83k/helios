HELIOS: Hub for Execution, Leads, Intelligence & Operations Systems

The blueprint: TG Automation Platform

One codebase. Many clients.
Each client is just:

.env

client.yml (feature toggles + texts)

optional connectors enabled

Core idea

Everything is a Module that exposes:

routes() (TG handlers)

jobs() (scheduled tasks)

admin_actions() (buttons for owner)

dependencies() (needs Sheets? CRM? Payments?)

No module is allowed to hardcode business logic.

Modules you should have (minimal but powerful)
0) Foundation (mandatory)

Auth & Roles

user / admin / operator

allowlist admins by TG ID

Conversation Engine

FSM router

reusable “ask/validate/save” helpers

Storage

SQLite by default

abstraction layer so you can swap to Postgres later

Config & Feature Flags

client.yml enables modules + settings

1) Money modules (sell these first)

Lead Capture

buttons → questions → confirm

push to Sheets/CRM

notify owner

FAQ / Menu

editable from YAML

quick replies

Broadcast / Campaigns

admin sends message to segment

rate limiting + opt-out

Booking

simple: collect preferred slot + send to operator

or integrate Calendly/Google Calendar later

2) “Entrepreneur assistant” modules (upsell)

Tasks & Reminders

“add task”, “today list”

daily digest to owner

CRM Lite inside Telegram

/leads list

status: new → contacted → won/lost

notes + follow-ups

Analytics Dashboard

leads/day, conversion, response time

weekly PDF/report to owner (you can generate and send)

3) Advanced modules (only when paid well)

Payments

invoice creation + webhook confirm

unlock features after payment

AI Copilot

ONLY for internal use:

rewrite reply

summarize chat

classify lead intent
Don’t do “AI answers customers” until you have strong guardrails.

Scrapers / Lead sourcing

careful: legality + ethics

better: “import leads from file” first

Client config example (client.yml)
brand:
  name: "Clinic X"
  main_menu:
    - faq
    - leads
    - booking

modules:
  faq: true
  leads: true
  booking: true
  broadcast: false
  crm_lite: true
  payments: false
  ai_copilot: false

leads:
  fields: [name, phone, service, preferred_time]
  target: google_sheets
  notify_admin_chat_id: -100123456789

faq:
  source: "config/clients/clinicx_faq.yml"


This is how you “assemble” solutions fast without rewriting code.

Packaging (how you make quick money without custom hell)
Package S — LeadBot (48 hours)

FAQ + Lead capture + owner notifications + Sheets
80k–120k KZT setup + 20k/mo

Package M — LeadBot Pro (3–5 days)

Booking + CRM-lite + Broadcast
150k–300k KZT setup + 40k/mo

Package L — Operator Suite (1–2 weeks)

Payments + Analytics reports + AI copilot for admin
400k+ KZT + 60k–120k/mo

If they want “AI-agent that finds clients” but can’t pay Package L:
they don’t want an agent — they want a miracle. Pass.

Deployment (simple, profitable)

You host on one VPS

each client = one container

daily backups

You sell hosting as part of monthly support. That’s your compounding income.

One more ruthless note

Your “AI-agent for getting clients” idea is sexy… and usually a time-waster.
Start with lead capture + CRM-lite + automation. That prints money now.
Then add AI as an upsell once you have 2–3 paying clients and real data.
